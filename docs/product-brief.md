# Product Brief: One-Minute Dungeon

> **Executive Summary:** A mobile-first PWA that distills the 4-hour D&D session into a 60-second dopamine loop. Players make 3-5 rapid-fire choices to survive a dungeon, revealing a unique "Adventurer Title" and rarity score on a shareable, visually stunning card.

## 1. Problem & Opportunity

| **The Problem** | **The Opportunity** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time Scarcity:** Core RPG audiences (Millennials/Gen-Z) have shrinking free time; 40+ hour games stay in the backlog. | **Micro-Engagement:** A "coffee break" RPG that delivers a complete narrative arc (Start -> Challenge -> Resolution) in <60 seconds. |
| **Lack of Closure:** Mobile games often have no "end," just endless grinding (Gacha/Casual). | **Clear Win State:** Every run finishes with a definitive outcome (Win/Die) and a permanent "collectible" achievement. |
| **Social Friction:** "Check out my LVL 50 Paladin" is hard to share meaningfully. | **Viral Artifacts:** A generated 9:16 card (Instagram Story ready) that visually proves your status/luck/humor. |

## 2. Solution Overview

**One-Minute Dungeon** is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that serves randomly generated, text-based micro-adventures with high-stakes choices.

### Core Loop
1.  **Enter (5s):** User taps "Enter Dungeon".
2.  **Survive (45s):** Faced with 3-5 branching scenarios (Combat, Trap, Puzzle).
3.  **Result (10s):** The game calculates a hidden score based on **Stats + RNG + Choices**.
4.  **Reward:** Generate a **Unique Ending Card** (e.g., *"The Clumsy Goblin Slayer - Rare"*).

## 3. Key Features

| Feature | Description | Value Prop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **⚡ Micro-Adventure Engine** | A branching narrative system that forces 3-5 binary choices under time pressure. | Delivers a "complete" adventure feeling in under a minute. |
| **🎲 Hidden Stat + RNG System** | Outcomes aren't random; they are weighted by invisible stats (Str/Dex/Int) tracked during the run. | Makes choices feel meaningful without burdening the user with spreadsheets. |
| **🃏 Dynamic Share Card** | Auto-generates a 9:16 vertical image with the user's title, death cause, and "rarity" score. | Drives organic growth via social sharing (IG/TikTok/Discord). |
| **🏆 Title & Rarity System** | "Gacha for Endings." Hundreds of possible titles, from "Common Peasant" to "Legendary Dragon Rider." | Hooks collectors and achievers; drives replayability. |
| **⚔️ Themed Dungeons (Premium)** | Unlockable themes (Sci-Fi, Horror, Cyberpunk) for variety. | Monetization lever for engaged users. |

## 4. Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Millennials & Gen-Z (25-40) who grew up on RPGs but now have "adult jobs" and limited time.
*   **Secondary:** Boomers/Casuals who enjoy simple text adventures or logic puzzles.
*   **Psychographics:** "Achievers" (want the rarest title) and "Socializers" (want to share the funniest death).

## 5. Business Model (Freemium)

| Revenue Stream | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Free Tier** | Unlimited "Standard" dungeon runs (ad-supported). |
| **Premium (IAP/Sub)** | Unlock "Themed Dungeons" (e.g., Sci-Fi, Horror, Cyberpunk) or "Class Packs". |
| **Cosmetics** | Paid card skins/frames (e.g., Holographic foil effect on share card). |

## 6. Differentiation & Tone

*   **Tone:** **Classic D&D Medieval** meets **Satirical Humor**. Think *Monty Python* or *The Bard's Tale*. Serious stakes, but funny outcomes (e.g., "You tripped on your own sword. Critical Failure.").
*   **Platform:** **PWA** (Instant load, no app store friction, installable to home screen).
*   **Visuals:** Minimalist UI during gameplay -> High-fidelity, rich art for the **Share Card** (The "Payoff").

## 7. Success Metrics (KPIs)

*   **Viral Coefficient (K-Factor):** > 1.0 (Each user brings >1 user via Share Cards).
*   **Retention:** D30 Retention > 15% (High for hyper-casual).
*   **Completion Rate:** > 90% (Due to short session length).
